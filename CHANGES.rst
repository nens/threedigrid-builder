  was provided by the user.


1.8.0 (2023-01-19)
------------------

- Replaced threedi-modelchecker dependency with threedi-schema==214.*.

- Replaced pygeos with shapely 2.*.


1.7.1 (2023-01-18)
------------------

- Fixed breaches.line_id when there are boundary conditions in the model.

- Revert "1D-2D lines derived from exchange lines are also converted to breaches"
  from version 1.7.0.


1.7.0 (2023-01-11)
------------------

- Fix build with numpy >= 1.24

- Require schema version 214 (threedi-modelchecker >= 0.35).

- Set 1D-2D line dpumax based on v2_potential_breach.exchange_level >
  v2_exchange_line.exchange_level > highest intersected obstacle/levee
  > (existing logic) manhole/channel/pipe/culvert details.

- Associate breaches with 1D-2D lines: adapt the 2D side to the 2D side of
  the breach line. This overrides a possible exchange line. The content type
  is changed to v2_breach.

- Output breaches based on new breach lines.

- Adapt ds1d_half of 1D-2D lines to the spot where they cross a levee.

- Refactored connection node dpumax and calculation type assignment.

- Assign breaches to connection nodes according to the following priority:
  First, take the breach points of the first channel that has 2 breach.
  If there are no double breach points: take the breach points of the 
  first channel.

- Adapt 1D-2D lines generation for connection nodes to the exchange lines.
  A connection node derives its exchange lines from a particular channel.
  If the connection node has breaches assigned, take that channel. Else,
  take the first double connected channel. Else, take the first single
  connected channel.

- 1D-2D lines derived from exchange lines are also converted to breaches.
  These breaches have no properties.

- Draw breach points where the user-input linestring intersects the obstacle.


1.6.1 (2022-12-08)
------------------

- Fix setup.py (for sdist creation).


1.6.0 (2022-12-08)
------------------

- Adapt channel interpolated nodes based on the new v2_potential_breach table
  (only if the table exists).

- Adapt 1D-2D lines generation to v2_exchange_line table. Breaches are not implemented
  in that case. If there are no excange lines (or the table is missing),
  v2_connected_points are still used and breaches still work.

- Add TABULATED_YZ (7) and INVERTED_EGG (8) cross section shapes. Both are converted
  to tabulated trapezium.

------------------

------------------

- Write the literal WKT of the DEM projection into the gridadmin.


1.3.5 (2022-03-28)
------------------

------------------

- Write "grid_coordinate_attributes" also for pure 1D models.

- Make requesting spatial reference of GDAL dataset compatible with GDAL 2.x.

0.8.2 (2021-12-05)

- Fixed __version__ attribute and  "threedigrid_builder_version" HDF5 attribute.

- Set the dpumax of a 1D line (channel, pipe, culvert, weir, orifice) always to the
  largest of its two invert levels. Previously, it was set to the largest of the two
  bottom_levels of the two adjacent nodes, which gave wrong results for lines attached
  to manholes.

- Disable extrapolation for channel node/line attributes that are derived from
  crosssection locations.

- Disable the SchematisationError when a Manhole has a bottom_level above a level

------------------

- Handle embedded connection nodes. These are removed from the grid and written to a
  new dataset "nodes_embedded".

- Fixed bug with cross sections tables being None in Grid instance

- Handle embedded channels, pipes and culverts. Embedded objects result in
  embedded nodes and and lines with kcu LINE_1D_EMBEDDED between between 2D cells.

- Fixed a bug with lines that connect nodes to themselves in quadtree generation.

- Fixed a bug with wrong usage of lines.ds1d in bottom level and cross section weights

  was renamed to nodes.s1d.

- Added invert_level_start_point and invert_level_end_point attributes to lines.

  These are used to compute the Lines.line_geometries for channel lines.

- Fixed a bug in the refinement areas code (Fortran) on Ubuntu 20.04.

- Added the Pipes model that is able to compute Nodes & Lines from Pipes.
  Pipes are also included in the calculation_type and bottom_level computations.

- Added 1D-2D lines for connection nodes, manholes, and channels.

- Added culverts, orifices, and weirs.

- Added pumps (pumpstations).

- Settings and metadata are read from the SQLite. Some metadata (like model_slug) can
  also be provided via the main (make_grid) function. The metadata is written to the
  root 'attrs' of the output gridadmin.h5. The settings are written into datasets inside
  newly addres groups "grid_settings" and "tables_settings".

- Fixes for models with no channels.

- Add an optional progress callback.


0.1.2 (2021-04-28)
------------------

- Added public API with 1 function: `threedigrid_builder.make_grid`.

------------------

- Fixed automatic PyPI upload.


0.1.0 (2021-04-20)
------------------

- Partially ported functionality from inpy (generate 3di files, makegrid): 1D channel
  grid (including calculation_type and bottom_level), and 2D open water grid.

- Added gridadmin and geopackage output.

- Breaking change: the interpolation between cross section locations (channels)
  now also extrapolates for lines and nodes  that are not in between two
  connection nodes. This happens only if the channel has at least 2 cross section
  locations. When extrapolatic, the line.cross_weight is less than 0 or greater than 1.

- Breaking change: missing or empty values in float datasets in the output gridadmin are
  now denoted by NaN (not-a-number) instead of -9999.0.

- Breaking change: integers in the output gridadmin are now always 32-bit (instead of
  sometimes 32-bit and sometimes 64-bit).
